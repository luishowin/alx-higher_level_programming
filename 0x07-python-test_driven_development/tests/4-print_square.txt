Prints a square of '#' characters with the specified size.

    Args:
    - size (int): The size length of the square.

    Raises:
    - TypeError: If size is not an integer or if size is a float and is less than 0.
    - ValueError: If size is less than 0.

    Example:
    >>> print_square(3)
    ###
    ###
    ###
    >>> print_square(0)
    (prints nothing, as it's a square with size 0)
